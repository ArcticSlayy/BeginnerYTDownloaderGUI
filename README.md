# BeginnerYTDownloaderGUI
This is my first project in Python as I am only a beginner currently. Heavy inspiration from CoderCat100's terminal version.


As mentioned before, this is my first project, and I opted for PyQT5 as the GUI, no real preference, just one of the most recommended ones when looking around that I found easily modifiable. Please let me know of any optimizations, recommendations, requests, issues, etc. Again, this was heavily inspired from CoderCat, and I have added the UI File, and requirements.txt so that you can re-design, make your changes or expand.
